# Impact of convolutions on genomic prediction


## Finding the source of missing heritability
In this analysis we are looking to assess whether taking convolutions of genomic data can be used to improve genomic prediction.


# Ideas
This section can be used to assess any ideas before they go into the planning stage.

# Work
## ToDo
Simulate epistatic data source
Understand relation between important variables and predicted variables

## Doing



## Done
